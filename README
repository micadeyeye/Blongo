::::This is a branch of the Blongo project. Blongo is reused here to make a (conference) website::::

A django-based blog that uses mongodb as data store. It includes authentication mechanisms, such as django-registration-me and the default django_auth feature.  It can be re-used for various web projects.

To get started, create a virtual env, install the project requirements and start a project called 'blongo'. In addition, pull this project and  copy its contents into your project. 

I have included two files, namely references.txt and requirements.txt. They contain information on setting up the environment and solutions to problems you might encounter.
